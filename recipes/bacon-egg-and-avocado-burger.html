    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp. salted butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
      <li>8 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
      <li>1.5 lb. lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. steak seasoning</li>
      <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 large lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 avocados; peeled, pitted, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of the hamburger buns.</li>
      <li>Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp (10 to 12 minutes). 
Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set skillet aside, reserving grease.</li>
      <li>Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning together in a large bowl (do not overmix).
Form into 4 patties. Make a thumbprint in the middle of each patty to keep it from shrinking as it cooks.</li>
      <li>Grill patties on preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6 minutes per side.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
Top each burger with 2 bacon slices and a chedder cheese slice. Close grill lid until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
Remove patties from grill.</li>
      <li>Place buns on grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned; about 1 minute. Remove from grill, place 1 patty on bottom half of each bun.</li>
      <li>Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is still runny, about 4 minutes.
Immediately place 1 egg on top of each patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.</li>
    </ol>
