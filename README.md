# odin-recipes
A small example website that will show recipes.

This will demonstrate my HTML skills using links/images/paragraphs/headers/etc.

This will also show my Git and GitHub skills by progressively adding files to the staging area, doing local commits, and pushing to GitHub as the project goes on.
